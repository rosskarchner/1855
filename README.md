# 1855
This machine makes microblogs

The goal here is to create some [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates for bootstrap a [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)-based microblog, with ready-to-use, serverless implementations of Indieweb standards like [micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub), [indieauth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and others.

The name '1855' comes from the number of the legendary [Netiquette RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt)
