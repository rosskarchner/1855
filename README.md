# 1855

1855 will be a blogging platform implementating Indieweb standards like [micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub), [indieauth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and others, running in the AWS cloud.

Current status: Getting pretty close to being able to sign in with indieauth and author posts with micropub. You can see planned, in-progress, and completed standard support on [this board](https://github.com/rosskarchner/1855/projects/3).

The name '1855' comes from the number of the legendary [Netiquette RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt)
